# George CA – Game Portfolio 🎮

A small **game-style portfolio** built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
Instead of a normal static page, you explore a tiny world with a character and three houses:

- 🏠 **Skills House** – shows my tech stack and tools  
- 🏠 **Projects House** – shows projects I’m building  
- 🏠 **About House** – shows who I am and how to contact me  

The goal of this project is to learn front-end structure while also having a fun way to present my Python / data skills.
